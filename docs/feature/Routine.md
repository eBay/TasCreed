# Routine

**from: 0.3.1-RELEASE**

Routine is a new kind of executor, which is like a cluster level long run job, running a round and a round again, with a configured interval.

Not like a TasCreed job, users don't need to submit a routine to activate it, they just need to define the routines in the code, with the configured parameters. When the TasCreed nodes start up, they will try to occupy the routine job and start process.

At current, the TasCreed internal monitor thread and job watcher thread (to update job status and create new tasks) are refactored to be routines.

## How to define your own routine

The routine executor can be implemented based on two types of parent classes
- NormalRoutineExecutor
- CheckpointRoutineExecutor: with running state can be recorded in the bulletin

Usually, a normal routine executor is enough. The sample code defines a routine executor.

```java
@RoutineExec(routine="simple", scale = 2, interval = 15 * 1000L)
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class SimpleRoutineExecutor extends NormalRoutineExecutor {

    int i = 0;

    @Override
    protected void initImpl() throws TcException {
        System.out.println(String.format("routine [%s] init", routine.getFullName()));
    }

    @Override
    protected void executeRoundImpl() throws TcException {
        try {
            System.out.println("===== routine executor run round begins =====");
            i++;

            System.out.println(String.format("routine [%s] running %d", routine.getFullName(), i));

            System.out.println("===== routine executor run round ends =====");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected void closeImpl() throws TcException {
        System.out.println(String.format("routine [%s] close", routine.getFullName()));
    }

}
```

Similar to the task executor, the routine executor needs to implement some methods:
- initImpl: invoked when executor starts
- executeRoundImpl: invoked in a while loop, with a configured interval
- closeImpl: invoked when executor ends

The annotations are important.
```java
@RoutineExec(routine="simple", scale = 2, interval = 15 * 1000L)
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
```
- The `RoutineExec` defines a routine executor, and also defines a routine name, with some pre-defined parameters
	+ routine: string, routine name, mandatory
	+ scale: integer, default 1, indicates how many routine threads can be running in parallel across the whole cluster
	+ priority: integer, default 1, the routine with larger priority can be occupied in prioritize
	+ interval: long, in millisecond, default `60000` which is 1 minute, indicates the interval of the while loop to invoke the `executeRoundImpl` method
- The `Component` is the spring boot annotation, it is mandatory because
	+ The executors are constructed by spring boot
	+ The `RoutineExec` annotation implemention actually depends on the `Component` annotation
- The `Scope` is better to be defined as `@Scope("prototype")`

That's all, the routine is defined and will be registered by TasCreed, and it will be occupied and executed by the routine threads across the whole cluster.

## How to configure the routine threads across cluster

### Configuration of routine threads
```yaml
tascreed:
  routine:
    # num of overall available routines
    max.count.overall:
      key: "%s/max_routine_count_overall"
      default: 20
    # num of available routine thread per host
    max.count.per.host:
      key: "%s/max_routine_count_per_host"
      default: 5
```
This is the default configuration of routine threads
- whole cluster can run at most 20 routine threads, which can be overwritten by the properties file or etcd
- each TasCreed node can run at most 5 routine threads, which can be overwritten by the properties file or etcd

### Configure routine parameters
```properties
# tascreed routine param
tascreed.routine.param.job-watcher.scale=1
tascreed.routine.param.job-watcher.interval=10000
tascreed.routine.param.monitor.interval=5000
tascreed.routine.param.monitor.priority=101
```
The routine parameters are initially configured in the code, they can also be overwritten by properties file.

The format of the parameter configuration is like `{tascreed.routine.param}.{routineName}.{paramName}`, in this way, we can overwrite the default routine parameters as you like.

### Ban and resume routines

You can refer to the [doc of ban feature](BanJobs.md) to check out how to ban and resume routines.
