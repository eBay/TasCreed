# Params

## Data Type

At current, we only support string value parameters, configured or passed in as a `Map<String, String>`, for example:
```
  "params": {
    "k1": "v1",
    "k2": "v2"
  }
```

It can support most of the use cases, if you want to use non-string parameters, you can also parse it in your own application.

## Param Overwrite

The params can be configured in `JobDefine`, `StepDefine`, `Job Request`, `Job`, `Step` and `Task`. Only the TasCreed executors can use the params, so only the task params are the effective ones.

Therefore, all the params in non-task level are leveraged as default params, which can be overwritten. `Job`, `Step` and `Task` are generated, so their params are also generated, here will introduce how are these params generated.

### Job Param Generation

```
Job params = JobDefine params + JobRequest params
```
Job params are generated by JobDefine params and JobRequest params, the latter can overwrite the former.

### Step Param Generation

```
Step params = StepDefine params + StepRequest params
```
Step params are generated by StepDefine params and StepRequest params, the latter can overwrite the former. 

### Task Param Generation

```
Task params = Job params + Step params + Job updated params
```
Task params are generated by Job params, Step params and Job updated params, the latter can overwrite the former.

The job updated params are generated by task execution, as kind of task output, which can be passed to the later created tasks in this way. It can be used between the steps with dependency relationship, to transfer small size middle results.
